# Sweet Shop Management System

This is a full-stack project scaffold for the TDD Kata: Sweet Shop Management System.

## Structure
- backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB
- frontend: React + Vite

## Setup
See backend/ and frontend/ folders for details. The backend uses an in-memory DB for tests (mongodb-memory-server).

## My AI Usage
I used ChatGPT to scaffold this project and generate test templates. All AI-assisted commits should include a co-author trailer in commit messages.
